### Step 1 - Add TypeScript

- [ ] 📘 Add TypeScript, see [https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/)
- [ ] 🏗️ Convert javascript to typescript files

### Step 2 - Cleanup

- [ ] ♻️ Cleanup the application by splitting App into reusable, small components
- [ ] 💅 Optional: Consider adding [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install)

### Step 3 - Make it work

- [ ] 🚸 Display the actual genre name in stead of the genre id
- [ ] ✨ Clicking the "+"-icon on a post should add the movie to the watchlist
- [ ] ✨ Save the watchlist in localStorage, load it back from localStorage when visiting the app
- [ ] ✨ Selecting a "Sort by" option should sort the watchlist
- [ ] ✨ The "Genres" filter should display all genres found in the watchlist
- [ ] ✨ Clicking a genre in "Genres" should filter the watchlist, so only movies with the selected genre are displayed
- [ ] 💅 Format the date to e.g. 19 sep 2019
